Here are the approaches for each scenario:

1. High Bias, High Variance: B,C,D,E
2. High Bias, Low Variance: B,D
3. Low Bias, High Variance: A,C,E
4. Low Bias, Low Variance: F

Explanation:
- High Bias, High Variance: This means your model is underfitting and overfitting at the same time. You could try a different architecture (B), get more data (C), build a deeper network (D), or use regularization (E).
- High Bias, Low Variance: This means your model is underfitting. You could try a different architecture (B) or build a deeper network (D).
- Low Bias, High Variance: This means your model is overfitting. You could train more (A), get more data (C), or use regularization (E).
- Low Bias, Low Variance: This is the ideal scenario where your model is just right. You don't need to do anything (F).
