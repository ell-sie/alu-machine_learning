This project is about neural style transfer.
Neural Style Transfer is an innovative optimization technique designed to merge two distinct images: a content image and a style reference image. The process involves blending these images in such a way that the resulting output closely resembles the original content image but is rendered in the artistic style of the style reference image. This technique leverages neural networks to achieve a harmonious fusion between the detailed features of the content image and the stylistic elements of the style reference image, producing a unique piece that embodies both the subject matter and the aesthetic of the chosen art style.
